SW-HTTP
=======

For now this works as the only "real" example of usage:

  http://common-lisp.net/~lnostdal/programming/lisp/symbolicweb/src/server-sw-http.lisp


You basically:

  * Sub-class SERVER and set the APPLICATION-FINDER-FN slot to a callback that
    generates your content.
  
  * Creates an instance of your server subclass;

      (defparameter *server* (make-instance 'my-server :port 5002))

      
  * Start listening:

      (start-listening *server*)
     

  * Then point your browser to http://localhost:5002/
